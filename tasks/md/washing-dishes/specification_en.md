# Washing the Dishes: Workshop Exercise

We all know the magical times of the year when the Christmas spirit makes its way into our hearts and our relatives&mdash;into our homes… Imagine you just had your big family over for a Christmas dinner and now you have to wash up all the dishes – an amount suitable for a small restaurant.

## Scenario

Since you have a very supportive spouse, they volunteer to do all the washing and you volunteer to eat the rest of the dessert. The only condition is to explain to them in detail how to use the dishwasher&mdash;step by step.

## Task Requirements

* Your procedure should adhere to the recommendations for good documentation you have received.
* Your procedure should consist of the following elements:
	* A task-oriented title that expresses the user goal
	* A prerequisites section, if needed
	* Step-by-step breakdown of the procedure

## Tip

Choose any of the dishwashing devices you feel comfortable with. For example, the old school way in the sink.
