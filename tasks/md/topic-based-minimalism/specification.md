1. **Exercise 2**               

	**Creating test cases**               
	
	Projects are collections of files that are related to a test case. When you create a test case, you must also create a project. You can, however, create a project before you create a test case. Each project can contain multiple test case files but only one main test case. You create projects in suites; each suite can contain multiple projects. If you create one suite for each function that you test, the projects in a suite can contain the test cases that you create to test the function.            
	
	To create a suite:              
		1. Right-click a suite object and select **New** from the menu.             
		2. Specify details in the New Suite window.            
	
	To create a project:              
		1. Right-click a suite object and select **New Project** from the menu.              
		2. Specify details in the **New Project** window.            
	
	To create a test case:              
		1. Right-click a project and select **New Test Case** from the menu.              
		2. Specify details in the **New Test Case** window.            
		3. Click **Record** and work with the product that you want to test.               
		4. Click **Save** after you finish recording your actions.              

1. **Exercise 3**               

	**Lentil Chili**

	8 cups low-sodium vegetable broth, divided/1 medium yellow onion, chopped/1 large red bell pepper, chopped/5 cloves garlic, finely chopped/4 teaspoons salt-free chili powder /1 (16-ounce) package brown lentils (about 2 1/4 cups lentils) /2 (15-ounce) cans no-salt-added diced tomatoes/1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro.
