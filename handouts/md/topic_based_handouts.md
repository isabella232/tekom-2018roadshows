# Topic-Based Writing: Handouts

## What Is a Topic?

* A topic is a unit of information with a title and some form of content. It is short enough to be specific to a single subject or answer a single question, but long enough to make sense on its own and be authored as a unit.
*	A topic is a complete topic when it has:
*	A well-defined heading.
*	Context that makes the topic relevant.
*	Additional information to understand that context.
*	Details about what to do.
*	Examples to help readers understand the topic.

> If you write in complete topics, you can get consistently good results for reuse and global use.

## Types of Topics

|Topic type |Description|
|:---				|:---				|
|Concepts 	|<ul><li>Concept topics answer "What is..." questions.</li> <li>Provide conceptual, descriptive or background information.</li></ul> |
|Tasks		 	|<ul><li>Are the essential building blocks.</li> <li>Task topics answer "How do Iâ€¦?" questions.</li> <li>Focus on what the user wants or needs to do.</li></ul> |
|Reference Topics 	|<ul><li>Describe regular features of a subject or product.</li> <li>Provide details a user needs to complete technical tasks.</li> <li>Often appear as lists and tables.</li></ul> |


## Topic-Based Authoring and Forming a Narrative

*	List and organize the tasks
		1.	What does the user need to do?
		2.	Identify relationships between the tasks.
* Add and organize the concepts
		1.	What does the user need to understand before performing the tasks?
		2.	Identify relationships between concepts and tasks.
* Add the reference topics
		1.	What does the user need to refer to when performing the tasks?
		2.	Organize the reference topics and identify relationships between all of your topics.
